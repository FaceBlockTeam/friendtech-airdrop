# friendtech-presale

These are open-source smart contracts for anyone to build on top of.

Feel free to fork and build more features and/or build a UI to allow people to use easily!

Why are we building this?
- We want to do our part in adding value to the community.
- A significant pain point in FriendTech right now is that big accounts can't launch without getting sniped by bots.
- Bots take profit and usually take value out of the ecosystem, which is not helpful for growth.
- Snipe prevention on its own is cool, but it actually gates other users from entering at early prices because the creator hoards the early keys.
- Creators have no way of distributing to loyal fans / creating a diverse group of key holders.
